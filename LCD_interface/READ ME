- This library ultilizes other libraries such as the LiquidCrysyal library.

- Programmed for 12C 16x2 LCD! (Most likely works with others, but this was programmed with 16x2 in mind)

- Code will create a considerably interactable user interface on an LCD by using a rotary encoder.

- Pins are defaulted at specific values(values can be found in the header file). (NOTE: fix this eventually)

- An array is passed into the interface() method, and all strings are centered and automatically used to conveniently create a list to be navigated with the rotary encoder.

- Changing the array used (passed into interface() ), or by using other objects will allow for different lists to have menus and sub menus. (NOTE: finish implementing this)

- Note: Allow encoder to be used with an interrupt service routine.
